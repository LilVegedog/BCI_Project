## Devlopment Setup Instructions
  1. Clcik the <> Code Green button, in **Local**, Copy the Clone URL ```https://github.com/LilVegedog/BCI_Project.git```
  2. In your computer, Choose one folder, right click it, find "Git Bash Here" and click it. Then a terminal window would pop up.
  3. In the terminal, type:
     ``` git clone https://github.com/LilVegedog/BCI_Project.git```
     and return(click "enter" key). The the result should show like this:
     ``` Cloning into 'BCI_Project'...\
        remote: Enumerating objects: 41, done.\
        remote: Counting objects: 100% (41/41), done.\
        remote: Compressing objects: 100% (33/33), done.\
        remote: Total 41 (delta 11), reused 32 (delta 5), pack-reused 0\
        Receiving objects: 100% (41/41), 27.78 MiB | 24.35 MiB/s, done.\
        Resolving deltas: 100% (11/11), done.```
  4. In the terminal, type  ``` ls ``` to check whether there is a folder BCI_Project/ exist.
  5. type ``` code .``` and the Visual Studio Code will automatically pop up the window and open the BCI_Project Folder.
     
> [!NOTE]  
> MNE-Python requires Python version 3.8 or higher, if you need help installing Python, please refer to the [Install Python](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

6. (If your current python environment have: mne,numpy,matplotlib,plotly,pandas, then you can skip this.)
     - ```ctrl + ` ``` open the terminal.
     - type ```pip install mne ```
     - type ```pip install numpy ```
     - type ```pip install h5py ```
     - type ```pip install matplotlib ```
     - type ```pip install plotly ```
     - type ```pip install pandas ```
